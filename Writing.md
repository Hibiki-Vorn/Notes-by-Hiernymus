Hello,my Principal:<br>
I hope this email finds you well.My name is Eburotiko.I am the president of the student council of Francesco School.Which project I have chosen is "A pop-up repair and share centre".Nowadays,most of people became more rich than ever.Therefore, many people are not focus on money.And then,people are pursue a convenient life.So there is a 'throw-away' culture.The 'throw-away' culture brought convenience but it also brought wast and rubbish.I am not very rich.So I should save some money.Many 'throw-away' things will noly make my family poor.


So I recommend the principal to choose 'A pop-up repair and share centre'.Because this project can tech us how to fix electronic devices.Usually most of smart phone can use about 9 years.But average frequency of change their phone are 3 years.It is a waste.I can fix smart phone and I have fixed many phones.I am interested in fixing smart mobile phones.I am good at flashing phones and replacing battery of phones and putting a film on phones.This project can give the younger in commiunty a usefull skill because nobody can live in modenize city without smart mobile phone.If they saved money for buy new phones,then they can use the money to buy more another things.They can use the money to live a more happiness and beautiful life. 


And this project encourage people exchange something they do not need or went wrong but can not fix.This behavior can also reduce waste.For example,there is a phone that broken down and can not fix.We can use the metal of the phone to make other things.Every people can use things others used.It can make the community more warm and sweet.


This project can make the neighbourhood has less rubbish and make it great.


I hope you would take the time to consider my poposal.Thank you for taking the time to read through my email.

Thank you.<br>Your sincerely<br>Eburotiko<br>
