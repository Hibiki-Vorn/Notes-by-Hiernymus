Dear Mr Jia:
My name is Jehovah.I am the president of the student council of Francesco School.Which project I have chosen is "A pop-up repair and share centre".Nowadays,With the development of science and technology, the quality of people's life has improved.Therefore,There are many .And then,people are pursueing a convenient life.So there is a 'throw-away' culture.The 'throw-away' culture brought convenience but it also brought wast.But the sum of resource on the Earth is limited.Many 'throw-away' things will change the environment of the Earth.If we still live in the world about 'throw-away' the environment of the Earth will not suitable for human beings soon or later.


So I recommend the principal to choose 'A pop-up repair and share centre'.Because this project can tech us how to fix electronic devices.Usually most of smart phone can use about 9 years.But average frequency of change their phone are 3 years.For example many people buy an iPhone not because they need it but because Apple publish a new.It is a waste.I can fix smart phone and I have fixed many phones.I am interested in fixing smart mobile phones.I am good at replacing battery of phones and putting a screen provider.I can teach people in community how to fix phones.This project can give the younger in commiunty a usefull skill because nobody can live in modenise city without smart mobile phone.This project can make them realize that there is meaningless chaseing fashion and trend.


And this project encourage people exchange something they do not need or went wrong but can not fix.This behaviour can also reduce waste.For example,you had a cloth from when you was a kid.You can share the cloth with the community.Every people can use things others used.It can make the neighbour more clean because everyone's rubbish can trans to others' resources.


I hope you would take the time to consider my poposal.Thank you for taking the time to read through my email.

<br>Your sincerely<br>Jehovah
